For this dataset, since astronomers know the different properties that different star types/spectral classes tend to have, a good data scientist can and should use google to determine if an outlier value makes sense for the star type/spectral class or if it is a bad measurement that needs to be removed from the dataset. After dealing with missing values and outliers, add a text cell where you briefly explain the choices you made, but also feel free to add text cells explaining what you're doing intermittently to help the grader!\n",

Use an appropriate matplotlib or seaborn plot to visualize the distribution of star temperatures. Do not group by or separate the plots by star type or spectral class; we want all star temperatures in one distribution plot. Do you think Nick could model the star temperature distribution using a Gamma distribution? Explain your reasoning. Please google gamma distributions if you do not know what they are, and remember that Will Melville says that Wikipedia always has great descriptions of different probability distributions!\n",

If you run gamma.fit(x) on a list or numpy array or pandas series x, it uses maximum likelihood estimation to find the parameters of the gamma distribution (a, loc, and scale) that best fit the data x, so if you believe that you could fit a gamma distribution to the star data, or if you need help figuring out if a gamma distribution can fit the temperature data, it would be really cool if you actually did fit a gamma distribution using that maximum likelihood estimate and then plot the gamma distribution along with your temperature distribution plot. You won't necessarily be graded on this, but the grader thinks it's a cool idea, so do with that information what you will!\n"

Finally, you need to convert the x and y axis to the log scale. For help doing that, see this reference https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-plot-logarithmic-axes-in-matplotlib/"
