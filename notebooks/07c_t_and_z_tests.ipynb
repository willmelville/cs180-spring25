Semien and Sears had faced off against each other a number of times and Semien had performed well in those matchups. Suppose that they faced each other a total of $n = 25$ times, and Semien got 10 hits, so his batting average in those 25 at bats was $\\bar{x} = 0.400$, and the standard deviation was $s = 0.49$.

The idea of p values and statistical significance also applies to the other statistical tests we've learned about in class, namely KS tests. The only thing that changes is the assumption in the null hypothesis, so you just need to be aware of that/google that before you use the test."
